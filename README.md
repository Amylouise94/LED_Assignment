# LED_Assignment

To run the LED Display, use the command

pip install git+https://github.com/Amylouise94/LED_Assignment.git

Then in your terminal use the command solve_led --input *your own input*

This will generate the LED Grid and will tell you how many ligths are switched on/off after the LED Display. 

The system can take online inputs as well as local files, any incorrect spelling command will be ignored and if a value greater than the grid size or smaller than 0 is entered they will be adjusted to fit within the grid.
